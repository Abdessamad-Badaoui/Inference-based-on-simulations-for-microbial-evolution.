# Inference based on simulations for microbial evolution.
This project focuses on the application of modern statistical inference techniques, such as Approximate Bayesian Computing, to address a central question in biology: the dynamics of genetic diversity generation (mutagenesis) in bacterial populations (e.g., the generation of a variant conferring increased antibiotic resistance).
Various algorithms and techniques were employed to tackle this problem, including Binary Search, Gradient Descent, Metropolis-Hastings, and the ABC library.
